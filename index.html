      Our late payment calculator helps you to work out how much interest you could charge on an overdue payment. Many companies, especially small businesses, know the pain of late payments. When an invoice is overdue it can cripple the cashflow of the business. This can stall growth or, in the worst case scenario, late payments can even cause the business to fail.</p>

        The Late Payment of Commercial Debts (Interest) Act 1998 came into force on 1st November 1998 with the aim of helping companies facing these late payment problems by allowing businesses to charge interest on the debts that they are owed.
